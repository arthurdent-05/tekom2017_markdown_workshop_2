# Tekom - A True Story About GitHub
This is normal text, with a little __bold__ formatting. 
## This is a header 2
I would like this text to be shown in *italics*.

I have just deliberately created a line break!

This text is **_bold and italic_**. (Wow!)

Well, it's probably time for a list.
* Here's my first entry
* Here's another one

But that was just a bulleted list. What about a numbered list?
1. List entry 1
1. List entry 2

And a combination would be great, too.
1. List entry 1
   * Subitem 1
   * Subitem 2
1. List entry 2
   * Subitem 1
   * Subitem 2

What about a link :-) [tekom](http://tekom.de/)
