# My first time at Tekom
It's the third day and I must say I cannot really get my brain to work anymore in any language so writing an article is not in the realm of possibilities at this point.
However!
Here is a small list of the things I enjoyed in no particular order:
* The popcorn
* Leah Guren's cow stickers
* The energy at the Asian pavilion
* That dude in a black onesie surfing the exhibition on a skateboard yesterday
* The shuttle driver from yesterday who was just hired to get us from point A to point B and didn't care if we could understand our hotel names as he was shouting them across the bus

More to come on Parson AG's [blog](https://www.parson-europe.com/de/blog.html).
